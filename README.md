## Minimum Spanning Tree / Optimal Branching

> Minimum spanning tree is a connected tree structure 
> which is a minimal subgraph of a certain graph
> with minimal weights.
> (Sometimes referred as **MST**)

For undirected graph:

- [x] [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal's_algorithm)
- [x] [Prim's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim's_algorithm)

For digraph:

- [x] [Edmond's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds'_algorithm)

## Strongly Connected Component

> A graph is strongly connected if all of its vertices 
> are reachable from every others.

- [x] [Trajan's Strongly Connected Component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan's_strongly_connected_components_algorithm)
